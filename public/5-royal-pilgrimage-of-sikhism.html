        There are five Gurudwaras which are considered to be of religious importance in the Sikh religion. These five
        Gurudwaras are called Panj Takht which translates into five thrones are pilgrimage destinations and visiting all
        the five Takhts once in their
        lifetime is deemed important for all people of &nbsp;<a href="index.html"><span>Sikhism.</span></a>
      </p>
      <h1 class="main-heading blue padding size">1. Akal Takht</h1>
      <p class="paragraph-blog">
        Akal Takht (Throne of the Immortal) is the highest political institution of the <a href="index.html"><span>
            Sikhs
          </span></a> &nbsp; , founded by the sixth Sikh
        Guru, Guru Hargobind in 1606. Located in the famous Golden Temple complex in Amritsar, Akal Takht is one of five
        Takht of the <a href="index.html"><span>Sikhs</span></a>. These Takht are seats of power and authority between
        the Sikh community and the seat of the Jathedar, the highest spokes man among them. The Akal Takht is seen as a
        symbol of political sovereignty and justice, where the
        spiritual and earthly concerns of the Sikh people could be addressed and considered.
      </p>
      <h1 class="main-heading blue padding size">
        2. Takht Sri Kesgarh Sahib
      </h1>
      <p class="paragraph-hero">
        Takhat Sri Kesgarh Sahib Ji is a famous Gurudwara, is located in the heart of Anandpur Sahib and is one of the
        most divalent Sikh institutions in the country. It is one of the five highest seats of authority (takhts). The
        foundation stone was laid in
        1689 and Khalsa Panth was born here. The initiation of Khande di Pahul by Guru Gobind Singh Ji took place here
        on the holy day of Baisakhi in 1699. This holy shrine holds great importance among local people.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-hero">
        Takhat Sri Kesgarh Sahib Ji has a rich and glorious history. The invading armies were never able to reach this
        place. It is one of the five supreme seats of authority (Takhats). It is home to numerous relics and memoirs
        from the past, including Guru Gobind
        Singh’s Khanda- the double-edged sword that was used by him to prepare Amrit, his personal dagger- Katara, his
        own gun that was gifted to him by one follower in Lahore, and the double-edged weapon called Saif, that was
        gifted
        to him by Bahadur Shah.

        <span class="text-span-18">3.</span> Takht Sri Damdama Sahib
      </h1>
      <p class="paragraph-hero _22">
        Located in Bathinda, Punjab, Takht Sri Damdama Sahib is one of the 5 takht of <a href="index.html"><span>Sikhism</span></a>. Takht, also called Seats
        of Temporal Authority, are religious places that have great significance in the Sikh religion. The one referred
        to is where the 10th Sikh Guru,
        Guru Gobind Singh Ji, assembled and instituted the Holy Book of <a
          href="index.html"><span>Sikhs</span></a>&nbsp;,
        Guru Granth Sahib Ji. The book is the
        only thing <a href="index.html"><span>Sikhs </span></a> worship. Not a person, image or statue, only Guru Granth
        Sahib Ji, the Holy Book which is the
        compilation
        of hymns, teachings and preachings of Sikh Gurus and some other people.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-hero _22">
        Sri Damdama Sahib was recognised as the 4th Takht of <a href="index.html"><span>Sikhism</span></a> in November of 1966 by Shiromani Gurdwara
        Prabandhak Committee and 5th Takht of <a href="index.html"><span>Sikhism</span></a> by the Government of India in April of 1999. Guru Gobind Singh Ji
        wanted to make this place a literary
        hub and read and wrote a lot during his stay here in 1706, which lasted nearly a year. He wanted to make a
        literary pool at this place so that no Sikh would remain illiterate. It was at this place that Guru Gobind Singh
        Ji
        revised and finalised Guru Granth Sahib Ji or the Adi Granth, which was originally compiled by Guru Arjan Dev
        Ji, and added the verses of Guru Teg Bahadur Ji, the ninth Guru and his father.

        <strong class="bold-text">4. Harmandir Takht, Shri Patna Sahib</strong>
      </h1>
      <p class="paragraph-hero _22">
        Harmandir Takht Shri Patna Sahib, popularly known as Patna Sahib
        Gurudwara is one of the holiest pilgrimages for the Sikh community.
        Located on the banks of holy Ganga, this Gurudwara in Patna, Bihar was
        built commemorating the tenth Guru of <a href="index.html"><span>Sikhs </span></a> &nbsp;, Shri Guru Gobind
        Singh.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-hero _22">
        The Gurudwara is regarded as the epicentre of <a href="index.html"><span>Sikhism</span></a> in Eastern
        India. Patna Sahib Gurudwara is the second acknowledged and accepted
        Takht of the five all total Takhts of <a href="index.html"><span>Sikhism</span></a>, which means ‘seat of
        authority’. A morning prayer called ardaas is being performed here
        every morning at 5:45 A.M and evening prayer at 6:00 P.M. The langar
        or free food service is offered here to all the visitors and visitors
        are also welcomed to volunteer in langar services since it is believed
        to be an offering to God. The Prakash Parv or the birth anniversary of
        Guru Gobind Singh Ji is celebrated in December every year which is one
        of the major attractions of this place.

        <strong class="bold-text-2">5. Takht Sachkhand Sri Hazur Sahib</strong>
      </h1>
      <p class="paragraph-hero _22">
        Hazur Sahib is a sacred monument that houses one of the five takhts or
        thrones of temporal authority. Also famous as Abchal nagar and Takht
        Sachkhand Sri Hazur Sahib, Hazur Sahib is a renowned location for Sikh
        Pilgrimage. This is where Guru Gobind Singh breathed his last in 1708.
        The temple or the Gurudwara was built around the location where Guru
        Gobind Singh was cremated. The stunning architecture of the Gurudwara
        is quite a treat to the eyes and so is the complex that extends around
        it on the banks of River Godavari in Nanded, Maharashtra. When Guru
        Gobind Singh Ji was discussing Guru ship on the sacred Guru Granth
        Sahib Book, he renamed Nanded as Abchal nagar which means a steadfast
        city. His teachings lead to a way of thinking that revolves around God
        and his truth. Thus, the place was also called ‘Sachkhand’ which
        literally means the region of truth.
