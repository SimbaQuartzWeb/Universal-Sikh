        Sri Guru Amar Das Ji - 3rd Sikh Guru
      </h1>

      <p class="paragraph-blog">
        After Sri Guru Angad Dev Sahib ji, who departed for his heavenly abode on 29 March 1552 at the age of
        48, Guru Amar Das Sahib Ji—also known as Nanak III—became Guru on Saturday, 16 April 1552 at the
        age of 73. He was the third of the Ten Gurus of Sikhism.


      <p class="paragraph-blog">
        Ten years after the birth of Guru Nanak, the first Sikh Guru and the founder of the Sikh faith, Guru Amar
        Das ji was born in 1479. Guru Ji was the oldest child of devoted mother Mata Lachmi Ji and farmer and
        trader Sri Tej Bhan Ji. He was a shopkeeper and resided in Basarke, a village close to Amritsar.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-blog">
        The third Sikh Guru was married to Mata Mansa Devi and they had four children - two sons named Bhai
        Mohan and Bhai Mohri, and two daughters named Bibi Dani Ji and Bibi Bhani Ji. Bibi Bhani later married
        Bhai Jetha who became the fourth Sikh Guru, Guru Ram Das. (See article Platforms of Jetha.)
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-blog">
        The following were gifts from Guru Amar Das Sahib to humanity:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji contains a total of 907 revelatory hymns written by the Guru.
        </li>
        <li>
          Gift of the Anand Sahib prayer, one of the Five Banis chanted every day by devoted Sikhs.

        </li>
        <li>
          All visitors to Gurdwaras, regardless of their caste, creed, status, or social standing, were required to
          partake in Langar, a free communal meal, before visiting the Guru (First Pangat, then Sangat).
          Emperor Akbar also sat in the Langar as a commoner before meeting with the Guru during his visit.
        </li>
        <li>
          Eliminated the caste system even more.
        </li>
        <li>
          Women's status was raised by Guru Ji, who also granted them equality with males. He firmly
          opposed customs like Sati—in which the wife is burned on her husband's funeral pyre—and Parda—
          a face veil—and supported widow remarriage.
        </li>

        <li>
          Created a management structure called a Manjis to handle the growing number of Sikh
          congregations.
        </li>

        <li>
          Established the city of Goindval on the banks of River Beas in 1552 A.D.
        </li>



      </ul>

          Early Life

        </h1>
        <p class="paragraph-blog">
          It is said that Bhai Amardas Ji, as he was known at the time, was a very pious Vaishanavite Hindu who
          spent the most of his life carrying out all of the customary pilgrimages and fasts of a devoted Hindu
          before converting to Sikhism. Bhai Sahib was deeply moved by Guru Angad Dev Sahib Ji's message when
          they first met in 1539, and he later converted to Sikhism. His involvement in Sewa (Service) to the Guru
          and the Community soon spread. Bhai Amardas Ji developed into a devoted Sikh under the influence of
          Sri Guru Angad Dev Sahib Ji and the teachings of the Gurus. He chose Guru Ji to be his spiritual mentor
          (Guru). At Khadur Sahib, Bhai Sahib Ji started residing.</p>
        <p class="paragraph-blog">
          He would get up early in the morning, bring water from the Beas River for Guru ji's bath, wash the Guru
          ji's garments, and go get wood for "Guru ka Langar" from the jungle. He was so entirely devoted to Sewa
          and the Guru, had completely eradicated pride, and was completely lost in this dedication that he was
          regarded as an elderly man who had lost interest in life, called Amru, and was largely abandoned.</p>
        <p class="paragraph-blog">
          But Bhai Sahib's devotion to the Sikh cause and dedication to Sikhi values led Sri Guru Angad Dev Sahib
          Ji, who was then 73 years old, to name Sri Guru Amar Das Sahib Ji as the third Sri Guru Nanak Sahib in
          March 1552. He established his headquarters at the newly built town of Goindwal Sahib, which Sri Guru
          Angad Dev Sahib Ji had established.
        </p>

        Meeting Bhai Jetha


      </h1>

      <p class="paragraph-blog">
        When the Guru decided it was time for his younger daughter Bibi Bhani to get married, he chose a pious
        and committed young devotee from Lahore by the name of Jetha. Jetha had travelled to visit the Guru
        with a group of Lahore pilgrims, and after being so moved by the Guru's teachings, he had made the
        decision to settle in Goindwal. He made a life here by selling wheat and spent his free time going to
        Guru Amar Das Ji's services on a regular basis.

      </p>

      <p class="paragraph-blog">
        None of Guru Amar Das Sahib's sons were deemed suitable for the position of guru, therefore he
        appointed his son-in-law, Guru Ram Das, to succeed him. The fact that Bibi Bhani and (Guru) Ram Das
        had a sincere sense of service and a thorough grasp of the Sikh teachings made it a practical rather than
        an emotional decision. This tradition demonstrates that the Guruship may be transferred to any person
        who was suitable for the Sikh cause, regardless of whether they belonged to the same family or not. At
        the ripe old age of 95, Guru Amar Das Sahib departed away for heaven on September 1, 1574 at
        Goindwal Sahib in District Amritsar, after entrusting the Fourth Nanak, Guru Ramdas, with the duties of
        Guruship.
