      <p class="paragraph-blog">
        Sikh Gurus are known for their teachings and sacrifice in India. They were tortured several times by various
        Mughal emperors for conversion into Islam religion. But they sacrificed their lives for the sake of their
        religion. Every Sikh is therefore proud
        of them being Sikh. Sikh community is known worldwide for their service towards mankind. Shabad Kirtans and free
        food are offered to devotees on &#x27;Gurpurabs&#x27;. Sikh Gurus introduced teaching of all humans equally
        irrespective
        of their caste, creed and gender. All Sikh Gurus made a valuable contribution towards Guru Granth Sahib ji - the
        holy book worshiped by <a href="index.html"><span>Sikhs</span></a>.
      </p>
      <h1 class="main-heading blue padding size">
        1. Guru Nanak Dev Ji: From 1469 to 1539
      </h1>
      <p class="paragraph-hero">
        The first of the Gurus and the founder of the Sikh religion was Guru Nanak. He was born at Talwandi (now known
        as Nankana Sahib in Pakistan) on October 20, 1469. Guru ji mastered Punjabi, Sanskrit and Persian at an early
        age and in childhood revolted
        against ritualism, caste, prejudices, hypocrisy and idolatry. He regarded Hindus and Muslims as equals and
        referred to himself as neither Hindu nor Muslim but as a brother to all those who believed in God and truth.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-hero">
        He made four great journeys, traveling to all parts of India, and into Arabia and Persia; visiting Mecca and
        Baghdad. He spoke before Hindus, Jains, Buddhists, Parsees, and Muslims. He spoke in the temples and mosques,
        and at various pilgrimage sites.
        Wherever he went, Guru Nanak spoke out against empty religious rituals, pilgrimages, the caste system, the
        sacrifice of widows, of depending on books to learn the true religion, and of all the other tenets that were to
        define
        his teachings. Never did he ask his listeners to follow him. He asked the Muslims to be true Muslims and the
        Hindus to be true Hindus.
      </p>
      <h1 class="main-heading blue padding size">
        2. Guru Angad Dev Ji: From 1539 to 1552
      </h1>
      <p class="paragraph-blog">
        He was born in 1504. Guru Angad invented and introduced the Gurmukhi (written form of Punjabi) script and made
        it known to all <a href="index.html"><span>Sikhs</span></a>. The scripture of the Guru Granth Sahib Ji is written in Gurmukhi. This scripture is also
        the basis of the Punjabi language.
        It became the script of the masses very soon. Guru Angad was a model of selfless service to his <a href="index.html"><span>Sikhs</span></a> and showed
        them the way to devotional prayers. He took great interest in the education of the children by opening many
        schools
        for their instruction and thus greatly increased literacy. For the youth he started the tradition of Mall
        Akhara, where physical as well as spiritual exercises were held. He collected the facts about Guru Nanak
        Sahib&#x27;s
        life from Bhai Bala ji and wrote the first biography of Guru Nanak Sahib. He also wrote 63 Saloks, these were
        included in Guru Granth Sahib. He popularized and expanded the institution of &#x27;Guru ka Langar&#x27; started
        by Guru Nanak Sahib earlier.
      </p>
      <h1 class="main-heading blue padding size">
        <span class="text-span-18">3.</span> Guru Amar Das Sahib Ji: From 1552 to 1574
      </h1>
      <p class="paragraph-hero _22">
        He was born in 1479. Guru Amardas took up cudgels of spirituality to fight against caste restrictions, caste
        prejudices and the curse of untouchability. He strengthened the tradition of the free kitchen, Guru Ka Langar
        (started by Guru Nanak), and made
        his disciples, whether rich or poor, whether high born or low born (according to the Hindu caste system), have
        their meals together sitting in one place. He thus established social equality amongst the people. Guru Amardas
        introduced the Anand Karaj marriage ceremony for the <a href="index.html"><span>Sikhs</span></a>, replacing the Hindu form. He also completely
        abolished amongst the <a href="index.html"><span>Sikhs</span></a>, the custom of Sati, in which a married woman was forced to burn herself to death in
        the funeral
        pyre of her husband. The custom of Paradah (Purda), in which a woman was required to cover her face with a veil,
        was also done away with.
      </p>
      <h1 class="main-heading blue padding size">
        <strong class="bold-text">4. Guru Ram Das Sahib Ji: From 1574 to 1581</strong>
      </h1>
      <p class="paragraph-hero _22">
        He was born in 1534. Guru ji founded the city of Amritsar and started
        the construction of the famous Golden Temple at Amritsar, the holy
        city of the <a href="index.html"><span>Sikhs</span></a>. He requested the, Muslim Sufi, Mian Mir to lay the
        cornerstone of the Harmandir Sahib. The temple remains open on all
        side sand at all times to everyone. This indicates that the <a href="index.html"><span>Sikhs</span></a>
        believe in One God who has no partiality for any particular place,
        direction or time.
      </p>
      <h1 class="main-heading blue padding size">
        <strong class="bold-text-2">5. Guru Arjan Dev Ji: From 1581 to 1606</strong>
      </h1>
      <p class="paragraph-hero _22">
        He was born in 1563. He was the third son of Guru Ram Das ji. Guru
        Arjan was a saint and scholar of the highest quality and repute. He
        compiled the Adi Granth, the scriptures of the <a href="index.html"><span>Sikhs</span></a>, and wrote the
        Sukhmani Sahib. To make it a universal teaching, Guru ji included in
        ithymns of Muslim saints as well those of low-caste pariah saints who
        were never permitted to enter various temples. Guru Arjan Dev
        completed construction of Sri Darbar Sahib also known as Golden Temple
        in Amritsar.
      </p>
      <h1 class="main-heading blue padding size">
        <strong class="bold-text-3">6. Guru Har Gobind Sahib Ji: From 1606 to 1644</strong>
      </h1>
      <p class="paragraph-hero _22">
        He was born in 1595. He was the son of Guru Arjan Dev and was known as
        a &quot;soldier saint, &quot;Guru Hargobind ji organized a small army,
        explaining that extreme non-violence and pacifism would only encourage
        evil and so the principles of Miri-Piri were established. Guru ji
        taught that it was necessary to take up the sword in order to protect
        the weak and the oppressed. Guru ji was first of the Gurus to take up
        arms to defend the faith. At that time it was only emperors who were
        allowed to sit on a raised platform, called a takhat or throne. At the
        age of 13, Guru Hargobind erected Sri Akal Takhat Sahib, ten feet
        above the ground and adorned two swords, Miri and Piri, representing
        temporal and spiritual power.
      </p>
      <h1 class="main-heading blue padding size">
        <strong class="bold-text-4">7. Guru Har Rai Sahib Ji: From 1644 to 1661</strong>
      </h1>
      <p class="paragraph-hero _22">
        He was born in 1630, spent most of his life in devotional meditation
        and preaching the teachings of Guru Nanak. Although Guru Har Rai Ji
        was a man of peace, he never disbanded the armed Sikh Warriors (Saint
        Soldiers), who earlier were maintained by his grandfather, Guru
        Hargobind. He always boosted the military spirit of the <a href="index.html"><span>Sikhs</span></a>, but he
        never himself indulged in any direct political and armed controversy
        with the Mughal Empire. Guru ji cautiously avoided conflict with
        Emperor Aurangzeb and devoted his efforts to missionary work. He also
        continued the grand task of nation building initiated by Guru
        Hargobind.
      </p>
      <h1 class="main-heading blue padding size">
        <strong class="bold-text-5">8. Guru Har Krishan Sahib Ji: From 1661 to 1664</strong>
      </h1>
      <p class="paragraph-hero _22">
        He was born in 1656. Guru Har Krishan was the youngest of the Gurus.
        Installed as Guru at the age of five, Guru ji astonished the Brahmin
        Pundits with his knowledge and spiritual powers. To the <a href="index.html"><span>Sikhs</span></a> he
        proved to be the very symbol of service, purity and truth. The Guru
        gave his life while serving and healing the epidemic-stricken people
        in Delhi. The young Guru began to attend the sufferers irrespective of
        caste and creed. Particularly, the local Muslim population was much
        impressed with the purely humanitarian deeds of the Guru Sahib and
        nicknamed him Bala Pir.
      </p>
      <h1 class="main-heading blue padding size">
        <strong class="bold-text-5">9. Guru Tegh Bahadur Sahib Ji: From 1665 to 1675</strong>
      </h1>
      <p class="paragraph-hero _22">
        He was born in 1621 in Amritsar. He established the town of Anandpur.
        The Guru laid down his life for the protection of the Hindu religion,
        their Tilak (devotional forehead markings) and their sacred (janeau)
        thread. He was a firm believer in the right of people to the freedom
        of worship. It was for this reason that he faced martyrdom for the
        defense of the down-trodden Hindus. So pathetic was the torture of
        Guru Tegh Bahadur that his body had to be cremated clandestinely (a
        follower burned down his own home to cremate the Guru&#x27;s body) at
        Delhi while his severed head was secretly taken four hundred
        kilometers away to Anandpur Sahib for cremation. Because of his
        refusal to convert to Islam a threatened forced conversion of the
        Hindus of Kashmir was thwarted.
      </p>
      <h1 class="main-heading blue padding size">
        <strong class="bold-text-5">10. Guru Gobind Singh Sahib Ji: From 1675 to 1708</strong>
      </h1>
      <p class="paragraph-hero _22">
        He was born in 1666 and became Guru after the martyrdom of his father
        Guru Tegh Bahadur. He created the Khalsa (The Pure Ones) in 1699,
        changing the <a href="index.html"><span>Sikhs</span></a> into a saint-soldier order with special symbols and
        sacraments for protecting themselves. After the Guru had administered
        Amrit to his Five Beloved Ones, he stood up in supplication and with
        folded hands, begged them to baptize him in the same way as he had
        baptized them. He himself became their disciple (Wonderful is Guru
        Gobind Singh, himself the Master and himself the disciple). The Five
        Beloved Ones were astonished at such a proposal, and represented their
        own unworthiness, and the greatness of the Guru, whom they deemed
        God&#x27;s representative on earth. He gave the <a href="index.html"><span>Sikhs</span></a> the name Singh
        (lion) or Kaur (princess).
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-hero _22">
        He fought many battles against the armies of Aurangzeb and his allies.
        After he had lost his father, his mother and four sons to Mughal
        tyranny, he wrote his famous letter (the zafarnama)to Aurangzeb, in
        which he indicted the Grand mughal with his treachery and godliness,
        after which the attacks against the Guru and his <a href="index.html"><span>Sikhs </span></a> were called
        off. Aurangzeb died soon after reading the letter. Soon, the rightful
        heir to the Mughal throne sought the Guru&#x27;s assistance in winning
        his kingdom. It was the envy and fear of the growing friendship
        between the new Emperor and the Guru which led to the sneak attack of
        the Pathan assassins of Wasir Khan who inflicted the wound which later
        caused the Guru&#x27;s death.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-hero _22">
        Thus the tree whose seed was planted by Guru Nanak, came to fruition
        when Guru Gobind Singh created the Khalsa, and on 3 October 1708,
        appointed Guru Granth Sahib as the Guru. He commanded: &quot;Let all
        bow before my successor, Guru Granth. The Word is the Guru now.
